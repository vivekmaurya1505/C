        and press escape key and type :wqa to save file.        
  
        

 
for command line compilation of C source code on Linux.

Command for generating expanded source code (sunbeam.i)
>gcc –E –o sunbeam.i sunbeam.c

using ls command check sunbeam.i file created and using vim sunbeam.i check contents of that file.

Command for generating assembly language code (sunbeam.s)
>gcc –S sunbeam.c

Command for generating object code (sunbeam.o)
>gcc –c sunbeam.c

Command for generating executable code (sunbeam.out)
>gcc –o sunbeam.out sunbeam.o

OR

>gcc –o sunbeam.out sunbeam.c

to run program from sunbeam folder give command       ./sunbeam.out
