 int a;
	
 a is int var.

 int *p;

  p is a pointer to int.
	or
  p is a int pointer

 float *b;
  b is a pointer to float
  b is a float pointer

 char *c;
 c is a pointer to char
 c is a char pointer

---------------------
	pointer size is always 8 bytes.
     ( int pointer, char pointer, float ptr, double ptr,
      struct ptr, fun ptr, array ptr )

-------------------
	dereferencing int pointer, we retrive 4 bytes
	deref  char ptr, we retrive 1 byte

	inc int ptr, jump by 4 bytes
	inc char ptr, jump by 1 byte
